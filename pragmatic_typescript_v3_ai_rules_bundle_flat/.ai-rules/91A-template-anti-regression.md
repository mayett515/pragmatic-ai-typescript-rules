# Anti-Regression: [DOMAIN]

<meta-instruction>
This file records historical failures and bans recreating them.
</meta-instruction>

<incident-reports>
- Incident [ID]: [past bug or architecture failure].
</incident-reports>

<absolute-constraints>
- REGRESSION BAN [ID]: DO NOT [specific banned action].
</absolute-constraints>

<conditional-logic>
IF touching [system]:
THEN verify [previous fix] remains intact.
</conditional-logic>

<pre-flight-checklist>
1. [ ] Did I avoid all regression bans?
</pre-flight-checklist>
```

<absolute-constraints>
- DO NOT add positive directives to an anti-regression file unless explicitly required.
- DO NOT describe incidents vaguely.
- DO NOT merge multiple regression bans into one bullet.
</absolute-constraints>

<pre-flight-checklist>
1. [ ] Is every ban tied to an incident?
2. [ ] Is the file flat and routed?
</pre-flight-checklist>
