# Extension Lenses Overview

<meta-instruction>
The extension lenses are part of the schema. They are not new architectures. Use them to identify the shape of the problem inside the main layers.
</meta-instruction>

<positive-directives>
- Use lenses only when they reveal a real shape in the code.
- Map each lens back to Type Strategy, Functional Core, Procedural Shell, or Boundary.
- Prefer ordinary TypeScript over language cosplay.
- Explain the lens in practical TypeScript terms when teaching.
- Skip the lens when it adds no value.
</positive-directives>

## Lens map

```txt
Lua: typed executable config / plugin APIs
Factor/Forth: visible left-to-right data flow
Elm: model, message, update, command
Elixir/Occam: messages, workers, ownership, recovery
Julia: operations over variants
APL: arrays, tables, bulk transforms
miniKanren: constraints and matching
Starset: sets and membership
Simula: lifecycle over time
SNOBOL: typed parsing and patterns
Idris: simple guarantees in types
m4: boring codegen from one source of truth
```

<absolute-constraints>
- DO NOT mention a source language in code comments unless teaching.
- DO NOT build fake actor systems, rule engines, or DSLs for simple direct code.
- DO NOT replace clear TypeScript with language cosplay.
- DO NOT use a lens to justify overengineering.
</absolute-constraints>

<pre-flight-checklist>
1. [ ] What problem shape did I identify?
2. [ ] Which layer does the lens improve?
3. [ ] Did the lens reveal meaning or add ceremony?
</pre-flight-checklist>
