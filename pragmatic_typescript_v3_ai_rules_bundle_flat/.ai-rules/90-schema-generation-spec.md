# Engineering Specification: Schema Generation

<meta-instruction>
Use this file when generating or editing AI rule files. Optimize rule files for LLM routing and attention, not for human folder browsing.
</meta-instruction>

## Format matrix

| Syntax | Purpose | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| YAML frontmatter | metadata, globs, protocols | immutable schema memory |
| XML body tags | constraints, logic gates | hard operational fences |
| Markdown prose | examples, navigation | section anchors |

<positive-directives>
- Put YAML at the top of every `.ai-rules` file.
- Put routing/meta logic near the top.
- Put `<pre-flight-checklist>` at the bottom.
- Use XML tags for behavioral control.
- Use exactly one good and one bad example in domain rule files when practical.
</positive-directives>

<absolute-constraints>
- DO NOT exceed 15 total rules or constraints in one file.
- DO NOT combine multiple prohibitions into one compound bullet.
- DO NOT omit YAML frontmatter from `.ai-rules` files.
- DO NOT generate nested `.ai-rules` folders.
- DO NOT create orphan rule files not routed from `00-system-index.md`.
</absolute-constraints>

<pre-flight-checklist>
1. [ ] Does every generated rule file have YAML frontmatter?
2. [ ] Is the rule file directly routable from the index?
3. [ ] Did I preserve U-shaped attention flow?
</pre-flight-checklist>
